This is a problem from a programming competition. I came across this problem
when trying to prepare for a competition. The problem seemed very straight
forward and after trying it for a few hours, it turned out to be super
challenging. After declaring it to be too hard, I gave it up at the time. That
was more than two years ago. But I always kept this problem statement in my
mind and occasionally wonder about this problem's final solution.

This problem eventually came back to me. And now I don't have a valid excuse to
further ignore it. Time wise I am working and I have a bunch of free time after
work. I cycle to work and often wonder why I get to work at different speeds. I
also don't want to waste my life waiting for traffic lights.

All in all, being able to solve this problem means a lot to me.
